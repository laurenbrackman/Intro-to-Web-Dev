# Intro to Web Development Project

This was my very first web development project, built while I was in high school through a dual-enrollment intro to web development course at Carroll College. This marked my first introduction to coding and it was incredibly fun to me.

## About the Project
- Built with: **HTML & CSS**
- Purpose: Practice basic layout, styling, and publishing to GitHub
- Focus: Understanding the building blocks of the web

## Lessons Learned
- How to structure a web page with semantic HTML
- Linking CSS for consistent styling
- Pushing code to GitHub for the first time

## Notes
This course marked the start of my passion for web design and development. Since then, I went on to obtain my Computer Science degree from Montana State University.
