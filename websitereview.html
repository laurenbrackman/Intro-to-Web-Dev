		<h1><a href="http://rei.com">REI.COM</a></h1>
		<p>This website has large beautiful photos of mountains and landscapes that makes me want to get outside and adventure. Sandwiched between these photos are photos of highlighted products, such as hiking boots and fishing line. They break up sections of the page with different backgrounds, while maintaining a theme with grays blues and neutrals. The navigation bar is broken up by activity, such as biking or camping,  so you can quickly find the specific items you are looking for. Items are beautifully photographed on a crisp white background and have multiple angles and elaborate descriptions. The website also features a “Journal” with even more stories and photos of adventures, news articles, and “how-to” videos.</p>
		<h1><a href="http://apple.com">APPLE.COM</a></h1>
		<p>Apple’s home page pop with large images, bright colors, and bold typed statements, such as “Everything you love”. The website is clearly designed for mobile and computers. The website is actually animated, revealing more text when you scroll in a faded effect, and using videos of games as the background of the Arcade section. Big “learn more” buttons make navigation simple. When shopping, navigation is as simple as clicking on the image of an iPhone, iMac, or Iwatch. The website is full of crisp, colorful images on a white or black background, making every page visually interesting.</p>
		<h1><a href="http://craigslist.com">CRAIGSLIST.COM</a></h1>
		<p>While craigslist serves its purpose and is widely used throughout the country, it is the opposite of aesthetically pleasing. The white and grey color scheme and basic font are extremely bland and unexciting. If I had never heard of Craigslist before, I don’t think I would trust the website because of how outdated the design looks. All the links are the default blue and have no added features like changing colors when hovering. While this could be an intentional design, I dislike how every title is lowercase, even the Craigslist header. All the lists use basic bullet points. On actual sales items, there is little formatting and all the information is just stacked on the screen.</p>
